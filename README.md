# Introduction
**MyRPC is a high-performance, lightweight RPC framework designed to enhance communication efficiency and usability in distributed systems. It supports persistent connections between server and client, utilizes asynchronous I/O for calls, and incorporates heartbeat detection on the server side. Serialization and deserialization are performed using JSON, and calls are facilitated through the use of Spring annotations and dynamic proxies. MyRPC leverages the robust networking capabilities of Netty 4.X to ensure efficient data transfer. Additionally, it utilizes ZooKeeper's Watcher mechanism to dynamically manage, monitor, and discover client connections, as well as to implement server-side registration functionality.**
